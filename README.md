<p>This program is a web scraper used on https://www.merriam-webster.com/browse/thesaurus/ </p>
<p>The main purpose of this was for my random gamertag creator that can also be found on this github. </p>

<p>To use, open up in an IDE that is able to debug dotnet core console apps. I use vscode and included the folder in the project. If you don't then feel free to delete it.</p>
